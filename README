Uploading patches on a webpage is hard.  Command line uploading is the future!

### Installation

    pip install -e git://github.com/jbalogh/bzattach.git

If you want to make the script suck less, check out the source and run

    pip install reqs.txt

If you're not installing this in a [virtualenv][1] you're crazy.
